        <h1>Maja Blanca</h1>
        <p><strong>Maja Blanca</strong> is a soft, creamy Filipino dessert made primarily from coconut milk, cornstarch, and sugar. It is often enriched with whole kernel corn for texture and topped with latik (toasted coconut curds) or grated cheese. This white pudding has a jelly-like consistency and is usually cut into squares for serving.
            Because it uses cornstarch as a thickener, it’s lighter than many rice-based kakanin and has a smooth, silky texture. The sweet and milky coconut flavor makes it a favorite among children and adults alike.</p>


            <h2>Cultural Significance </h2>
            <p>Maja Blanca is a popular dessert during fiestas, Christmas, and family celebrations. Its use of coconut milk and corn reflects the abundance of local ingredients and the Filipino talent for turning simple items into festive treats. Easy to prepare and serve, it’s often one of the first desserts learned in Filipino households, making it a comfort food that connects generations and highlights the sweet, celebratory side of Filipino culture.</p>
