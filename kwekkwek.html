    <h1>Kwek-kwek</h1>
    <p><strong>Kwek-kwek</strong>  is a beloved Filipino street food made by deep-frying quail eggs coated in a bright orange batter. The batter is typically made from flour, water, and annatto powder (achuete), giving it its iconic orange color. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, kwek-kwek is usually served with a spicy vinegar dip or a sweet and sour sauce, and is often paired with other street food favorites like fishballs and kikiam.</p>



     <h2>Cultural Significance </h2>
    <p>Kwek-kwek holds a special place in Filipino street food culture. It’s a staple at food stalls near schools, markets, and transportation hubs, often eaten as a quick and affordable merienda (afternoon snack). For many Filipinos, kwek-kwek evokes childhood memories of hanging out with friends after school or grabbing a snack on a busy afternoon. Beyond just a tasty treat, kwek-kwek represents the vibrancy and resourcefulness of Filipino street cuisine—turning simple, accessible ingredients into something flavorful and uniquely Pinoy.</p>
