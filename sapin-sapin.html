        <h1>Sapin-sapin</h1>
        <p><strong>Sapin-sapin</strong> is a colorful, sweet, and sticky rice cake that is a well-loved delicacy in the Philippines. The name “sapin-sapin” literally means “layers” in Filipino, which reflects its unique appearance—distinct, vibrant layers often in purple, yellow, and white. Each layer is made from glutinous rice flour (galapong), coconut milk, and sugar, and is sometimes flavored individually: purple with ube (purple yam), yellow with jackfruit (langka), and the white layer is usually plain or coconut-flavored.</p>
        

        <h2>Cultural Significance </h2>
        <p>Sapin-Sapin is a festive delicacy often seen at birthdays, fiestas, and holiday celebrations. Its colorful layers symbolize joy, diversity, and unity, making it a favorite during Filipino gatherings. Originating from the northern regions of the Philippines, especially in Luzon, sapin-sapin reflects regional creativity and the Filipino love for sweet, shared treats. It also showcases how traditional ingredients like coconut and glutinous rice are turned into vibrant, meaningful dishes that bring families and communities together.</p>
