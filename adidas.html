    <h1>Adidas</h1>
    <p><strong>Adidas</strong> is the street name for grilled chicken feet, a flavorful and chewy Filipino street food favorite. The feet are marinated in a savory-sweet mixture of soy sauce, garlic, vinegar, and spices, then grilled over hot coals until slightly charred and caramelized. Despite their bony structure, chicken feet are prized for their gelatinous texture and rich flavor, especially when paired with spiced vinegar or a soy-based dipping sauce.


     <h2>Cultural Significance </h2>
    <p>Adidas is part of a family of boldly named street foods—like Betamax (grilled blood cubes) and Helmet (grilled chicken heads)—that showcase the Filipino knack for humor, creativity, and zero-waste cooking. Eating Adidas is a social experience, often enjoyed at night by barkadas (groups of friends) around smoky street grills or during inuman (drinking sessions). More than just a quirky name, Adidas represents the Filipino ability to turn humble, even overlooked, ingredients into something flavorful, satisfying, and full of cultural pride.
