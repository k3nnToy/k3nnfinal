    <h1>Pork BBQ</h1>
    <p><strong>Pork BBQ</strong>  is a well-loved Filipino street food made from thinly sliced pork marinated in a flavorful blend of soy sauce, calamansi (or lemon), garlic, sugar, ketchup, and black pepper. The marinated pork is skewered on bamboo sticks and grilled over charcoal, giving it a smoky aroma and a caramelized glaze. It’s often served with rice or eaten straight off the stick, sometimes with a side of vinegar or spicy dipping sauce.</p>

     <h2>Cultural Significance </h2>
    <p>Pork BBQ is a staple at Filipino gatherings—birthdays, fiestas, family reunions, and especially street-side merienda stalls. It embodies the communal and celebratory spirit of Filipino culture, where food is both nourishment and bonding. Found everywhere from city street corners to rural markets, Pork BBQ represents accessibility, flavor, and the joy of grilled food done the Filipino way. The sizzle of pork over open flames, the smell of the marinade, and the shared experience of enjoying it hot off the grill create a cultural connection that transcends generations.</p>
