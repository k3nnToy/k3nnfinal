    <h1>Fishball</h1>
    <p><strong>Fishball</strong> are round, bite-sized snacks made from finely ground fish meat (usually pollock or bangus), flour, and seasonings, shaped into balls and deep-fried until golden brown. They’re usually skewered on bamboo sticks and dipped into a variety of sauces—sweet, spicy, or a sweet-and-sour mix—served straight from a mobile street food cart. Fishballs are light, savory, and crispy on the outside, making them a perfect snack on the go.</p>



     <h2>Cultural Significance </h2>
    <p>Fishballs are arguably the most iconic street food in the Philippines. They’ve been a part of everyday Filipino life for decades, especially in urban neighborhoods. Vendors pushing carts and ringing bells are a common sight, drawing kids and adults alike for a quick, tasty bite. The act of skewering your own fishballs and choosing your preferred dip has become a shared experience—more than just eating, it's a mini social event. Fishballs reflect the communal spirit of Filipino culture, where simple joys are often shared in the most humble settings. </p>
