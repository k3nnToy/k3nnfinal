    <h1>Proven</h1>
    <p><strong>Proven</strong> (short for proventriculus), is a crunchy, flavorful Filipino street food made from the proventriculus part of a chicken’s digestive system. The chicken innards are cleaned, seasoned, and deep-fried until golden and crispy. Typically served in small paper cups or on skewers, proven is often enjoyed with vinegar dipping sauce or sometimes drizzled with spicy or garlic sauce. Despite its humble origins, proven has earned its place alongside other popular street snacks.</p>
    
     <h2>Cultural Significance </h2>
    <p>Proven is especially popular in areas like the southern parts of Metro Manila and nearby provinces such as Laguna and Cavite. Its rise in popularity speaks to the Filipino value of “walang sayang”—making the most of every part of an ingredient. What was once considered a throwaway part of the chicken is now transformed into a crispy, satisfying snack. Proven represents the ingenuity and practicality of Filipino street food culture: turning the overlooked into something delicious, affordable, and truly local.
