        <h1>Cassava Cake</h1>
        <p><strong>Cassava Cake</strong> is a traditional Filipino dessert made from grated cassava (kamoteng kahoy), coconut milk, condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, and sometimes cheese or custard topping. It is typically baked until firm and golden, with a rich, chewy texture and sweet, coconut-infused flavor. The topping may be creamy and slightly caramelized, making it even more indulgent.</p>
       
        <h2>Cultural Significance </h2>
        <p>Cassava Cake is commonly served during family gatherings, fiestas, and holidays. It reflects the resourcefulness of Filipino cookingâ€”transforming a simple root crop into a delicious celebration dish. Especially popular in rural areas where cassava is abundant, it symbolizes Filipino creativity, resilience, and love for hearty, home-cooked desserts that bring families together.
