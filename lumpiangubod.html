    <h1>Lumpiang Ubod</h1>
    <p><strong>Lumpiang Ubod</strong> is a fresh spring roll made with thinly sliced ubod (heart of palm), sautéed with garlic, onions, and sometimes mixed with shrimp or pork, then wrapped in a soft crepe-like wrapper. It’s topped with a sweet-savory peanut sauce and crushed garlic or peanuts, often served chilled or at room temperature. Unlike fried lumpia, this version is light, delicate, and refreshing—making it a popular choice for health-conscious snackers or as a side dish.</p>

     <h2>Cultural Significance </h2>
    <p>Originally from Silay City in Negros Occidental, Lumpiang Ubod started as a celebratory dish in the homes of Filipino elites and eventually made its way into everyday Filipino cuisine. It blends Filipino agricultural roots (literally, with heart of palm) with Chinese culinary influence (spring roll concept), and is often featured during fiestas, family gatherings, or special meriendas. Its elegant appearance and refined taste reflect a time-honored tradition of Filipino hospitality—where food isn’t just sustenance, but a thoughtful offering of care and creativity. </p>
