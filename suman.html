        <h1>Suman</h1>
        <p><strong>Suman</strong>  is a Filipino rice cake made from glutinous rice (malagkit) cooked in coconut milk, then wrapped in banana leaves and steamed. It is usually served plain or with a drizzle of sugar, latik (coconut caramel), or ripe mangoes on the side. The banana leaf not only holds the rice mixture together but also infuses it with a subtle earthy aroma.</p>
        <p> There are many regional variations of suman, such as Suman sa Lihiya, which includes lye water for a firmer texture, or Suman sa Ibus, shaped using young palm leaves.</p>
    
        
     <h2>Cultural Significance </h2>
     <p>Suman is a meaningful part of Filipino culture, especially in provinces and rural communities. It is often served during fiestas, holidays, and family gatherings, and is also given as a pasalubong (homecoming gift). The careful process of wrapping and steaming reflects Filipino craftsmanship, simplicity, and love for tradition. Making suman is often a family or communal activity, symbolizing unity and shared heritage.     </p>
